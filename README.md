# RANDOM DISTORTED VIEW SHOW SCRIPT

This thing currently only works on Windows. I'll update it to be multiplatform if there is any interest.

USAGE:
	- While the script is running, press R_CONTROL. Window focus on the script is not necessary.
	
TO COMPILE:
	- You need two non-standard Python libraries:
		- win32api 
		- win32con
	- You can get both here: https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32

FUTURE:
	- No plans. If people complain enough, I'll make conversions for OSX and/or Linux.
